# small-pokemon-battle-sim
A Pokémon battle logic simulator I made as a project in one of my programming classes.

I didn't add a whole lot of Pokémon because my main focus was making the logic correct (and also because I didn't have that much time for the project in school).

To run the program:
```sh
python main.py
```

Oh, and if you were wondering: I got a 100% on the assignment :)
